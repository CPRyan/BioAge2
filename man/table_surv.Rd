\usage{
table_surv(data, agevar, label)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset for mortality table}

\item{agevar}{A character vector indicating the names of the interested biological aging measures}

\item{label}{A character vector indicating the labels of the biological aging measures}
}
\description{
Mortality validation for biological aging measures
}
\details{
Mortality validation for biological age measures, adjusting for chronological age and gender and stratified by gender, race, and age
}
\note{
Chronological age, gender, and race/ethnicity variables need to be named "age", "gender", and "race"
}
